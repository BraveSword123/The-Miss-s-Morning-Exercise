## About

**The Miss’s Morning Exercise** is a word-guessing web game set in a Regency-inspired lesson. You play as a student being drilled by a stern governess who expects nothing less than perfection.

The game focuses on **Regency-era words** and encourages learning through definitions, careful guesses, and a small amount of pressure. (A *respectable* amount of pressure.)

---

## How to Play

You’ll be shown a mystery word and can either:
- **Propose a letter**, or
- **Declare the full word**

Each round includes a **definition** to help you deduce the answer, and you may also claim **one hint per word**.

---

## Game Rules

- You start with a **5-letter word**
- You win the game only by correctly solving a **15-letter word**
- You have **10 total chances** per round (letter guesses or full-word guesses)

### Progression / Difficulty
- ✅ If you guess the **correct word**, the **next word increases by +1 letter**
- ❌ If you run out of all **10 chances**, the **next word decreases by -1 letter**

### Assistance
- 📖 Every word includes its **definition**
- 💡 You may use **one hint per word**
